The assignment gave me a good opportunity to review my syntax and generic bash coding skills. The biggest thing i learned while working on this was figuring out a way to print out the top 3 scores. I came upon the sort flags, and realized you could sort by the columns of the lines. That was with the k flag with the option of 2 for the score column. Then i pipped it with head and uniq to get the top 3 unique user scores
