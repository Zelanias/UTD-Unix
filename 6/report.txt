I learned that functions should be before the main function, just like C++, or else it'll come up as undefined. I learned how to do FILE I/O, with its different modes. It reminded me to use \n whenever i wanted to get a new line. It also reminded me that int++ doesnt exist, and should use +=1 instead. The process I used was first writing a general outline, implemenitng first level logic, assuming the funcitons work how i want them to work, and then implment the functions.
